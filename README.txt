## Project Vision
The vision behind this project is to create a decentralized and transparent platform for educational content creators (authors) to monetize their work without relying on intermediaries. By leveraging blockchain technology, this contract ensures fair royalty distribution and empowers authors to retain control over their intellectual property.

The ultimate goal is to facilitate a global and efficient ecosystem where authors receive their deserved royalties in real-time, while buyers gain access to high-quality educational content.

## Key Features
- **Royalty Management**: Authors can define a royalty percentage for each book. Every time their book is purchased, the defined royalty is automatically transferred to their wallet.
- **Transparent Payments**: The contract ensures that all payments are handled transparently, with buyers paying the exact amount, and excess payments refunded.
- **Sales Tracking**: The contract keeps track of how many times each book has been purchased, providing authors and owners with clear data on their sales.
- **Decentralized Ownership**: Authors and owners receive payments directly, without any intermediaries taking a cut.
- **Secure Transactions**: Payments to authors and the contract owner are processed securely using best practices in Solidity, ensuring funds are safely transferred without vulnerability to attacks.
